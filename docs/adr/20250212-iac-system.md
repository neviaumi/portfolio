# Selection of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tool: Pulumi vs Terraform CDK

- Status: Proposed

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to own and manage a backend server (API) to enable the chat assistant feature for my frontend. My aim is to host this infrastructure using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** services, particularly **Cloud Run** for deploying Docker-based APIs. I’ve chosen GCP because AWS does not currently provide comparable pay-per-request hosting for Docker containers, and GCP’s **Cloud Run** and **Firebase** offer more attractive pay-per-request pricing and relevant features for my project.

To efficiently manage and automate the provisioning of this GCP infrastructure, adopting **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is essential. The IaC tool must fulfill the following priorities:

1. **Multi-cloud support** for potential future integrations or migrations.
2. The ability to use **imperative programming languages** (e.g., TypeScript or Python) instead of DSLs.
3. **Scalable state management** with minimal manual configuration.
4. A developer-friendly setup that allows me to quickly onboard and start managing infrastructure effectively.

This decision will guide my Proof-of-Concept (POC) implementation and future infrastructure provisioning workflows.

## Decision Drivers

- **GCP-Focused Infrastructure**: Key services include Cloud Run and Firebase, chosen for their functionality and pricing model.
- **Pay-per-Request Pricing**: The pricing approach aligns with projected usage and budget constraints.
- **Multi-Cloud Readiness**: Flexibility to extend infrastructure provisioning to other cloud providers like AWS or Azure in the future.
- **Developer Workflows**: Preference for IaC tools that integrate well with programming languages and developer workflows for faster adoption.
- **Simplicity in State Management**: A robust yet straightforward solution for handling state without significant configuration overhead.

## Considered Options

1. **Pulumi**
2. **Terraform CDK**

## Decision Outcome

After reviewing the available options, I have decided to proceed with a **Proof-of-Concept (POC)** for both **Pulumi** and **Terraform CDK**. The decision on which tool to adopt long-term will be based on ease of integration with GCP services, alignment with decision drivers, and overall developer experience.

### Positive Consequences

- The infrastructure for my backend API and Firebase features can be automated and standardized, reducing manual overhead.
- Both tools allow for easy adoption of modern programming languages, aligning with my existing skill set and workflows.
- Multi-cloud support ensures my infrastructure provisioning remains flexible for future changes or integrations.

### Negative Consequences

- Learning curve and additional time required to evaluate both tools during the POC phase.
- Potential long-term lock-in to the chosen tool’s ecosystem for managing infrastructure.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Pulumi

- **Pros**:
    - Supports programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Go, and C# in an imperative coding style.
    - Integrated state management backend (Pulumi Service), with support for custom state storage (e.g., GCS, S3).
    - Supports direct API integrations with GCP, enabling rapid adoption of new features.
    - Developer-oriented with less boilerplate compared to Terraform CDK.

- **Cons**:
    - A smaller community compared to Terraform, which may result in fewer pre-built examples/modules.
    - Pulumi-specific constructs may introduce migration challenges if switching tools in the future.

### Terraform CDK

- **Pros**:
    - Large ecosystem of providers thanks to Terraform, with extensive support for GCP and other cloud services.
    - Enables infrastructure coding with familiar programming languages (TypeScript, Python, Go, etc.).
    - Stable and mature backend for state management due to Terraform’s long-standing presence.
    - Ideal for tapping into Terraform's vast library of community-supported modules.

- **Cons**:
    - Initial setup for state backends like GCS requires more manual configuration compared to Pulumi.
    - Dependent on Terraform HCL abstractions, which may limit fully imperative-style workflows.
    - Slower adoption of GCP-specific updates compared to Pulumi, as Terraform relies on provider updates.
