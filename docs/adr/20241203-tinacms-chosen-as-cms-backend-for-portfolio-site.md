# TinaCMS Chosen as CMS Backend for Portfolio Site

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Deciders**: Developer (self)
- **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

---

## Context and Problem Statement

- **Business goal**: Manage content for my portfolio dynamically using a CMS rather than hardcoding the content into the site.
- **Technical problem**: Select a CMS backend that supports file-based persistence, enabling easy content management, visibility on GitHub, and compatibility with static site generators.

The portfolio will contain a significant amount of content, making local JSON or hardcoded content management impractical.

---

## Decision Drivers

1. The CMS must support local, file-based persistence so that content changes can be committed to GitHub.
2. The CMS should operate as a headless system, providing API access to the content for flexibility.
3. The CMS should run locally and remain simple to use while showcasing its value for job opportunities.
4. The solution should offer a positive developer experience and easy integration with the site.

---

## Considered Options

1. **Contentful**: A feature-rich cloud-based CMS with headless capabilities.
2. **WordPress**: A highly popular traditional CMS that can be extended into a headless CMS.
3. **PayloadCMS**: A lightweight headless CMS with various features but limited file persistence support.
4. **TinaCMS**: A modern CMS designed for static site generators, focused on visual editing and file persistence.
5. **DecapCMS (formerly Netlify CMS)**: A file-based CMS, but with poor documentation.

---

## Decision Outcome

- **Chosen Option**: **TinaCMS**
  - **Reasoning**: TinaCMS is specifically designed for file-based, local CMS use. It supports content storage over files, which are commit-friendly for GitHub. Its visual editing features allow changes directly on the production site, providing a superior experience compared to other options.

### Positive Consequences

- All content is committed to GitHub, making it visible for version control and collaboration.
- Lightweight and integrates seamlessly with static site generators.
- Allows visual editing directly in production for faster updates.

### Negative Consequences

- The visual editing feature requires the autogenerated client, complicating the configuration and coupling the CMS with the frontend.

---

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Configuration complexity for the visual editing feature.
  - **Mitigation**: Invest time in understanding TinaCMS documentation and creating reusable configurations for the autogenerated client.
- **Risk**: Tight coupling of the frontend and CMS may make migrations harder in the future.
  - **Mitigation**: Abstract frontend logic to decouple it whenever possible.

## Analysis of the Options

### **Option 1: Contentful**

- **Pros**:
  - Managed in the cloud with rich, advanced features.
  - Feature-rich and scalable for long-term solutions.

- **Cons**:
  - Requires payment to access all features.
  - Authentication management adds significant complexity.

---

### **Option 2: WordPress**

- **Pros**:
  - Extremely popular with a large ecosystem and countless troubleshooting resources.
  - Capable of managing custom content types with custom fields.

- **Cons**:
  - Requires significant custom code to extend into a headless CMS (e.g., exposing custom content types via plugins).
  - Configuration for headless use is overly complex and time-consuming.

---

### **Option 3: PayloadCMS**

- **Pros**:
  - Lightweight and headless by default.
  - Good developer experience with modern tooling.

- **Cons**:
  - Lacks file-based persistence, requiring additional tooling or workarounds for committing content files.

---

### **Option 4: TinaCMS**

- **Pros**:
  - Perfectly tailored for static site generators with file-based persistence.
  - Visual editing simplifies content updates directly on production, reducing reliance on a separate admin panel.
  - Easy implementation of custom models for more flexible content workflows.

- **Cons**:
  - Requires autogenerated client for visual editing, which increases configuration complexity.
  - Tight coupling between the frontend and CMS can make frontend migrations harder in the future.

---

### **Option 5: DecapCMS**

- **Pros**:
  - Supports file-based persistence and runs locally.

- **Cons**:
  - Poor documentation makes it difficult to set up and use effectively.
  - All content types are managed in one configuration file, creating management challenges as the project scales.

---

## Future Considerations

- Explore reducing the coupling between the CMS and the frontend to ensure migrations or scaling to a different CMS (if needed) is easier.
- Monitor the development and updates of TinaCMS to ensure long-term support and value.
