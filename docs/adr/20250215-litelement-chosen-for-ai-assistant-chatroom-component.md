# LitElement Chosen for AI Assistant Chatroom Component

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Deciders**: Team AI Assistant, including user and collaborators
- **Date**: 2025-02-15

---

## Context and Problem Statement

- **Business goal**: Build a reusable AI assistant chatroom component that can be deployed and consumed in multiple frontend environments (React, Vue, plain HTML, etc.).
- **Technical problem**: Identify the best technology stack to balance long-term flexibility, minimal dependencies, ease of development, state management effort, styling, reusability, and performance.
- **Scope**: Decision impacts the entire component design for cross-framework usage and future scalability.

---

## Decision Drivers

1. Need for **reusability** across frameworks or in plain JavaScript environments.
2. Desire for **minimal dependency overhead** and small bundle sizes.
3. Ease of **development and maintainability**, especially for reactive state.
4. Ability to **scale components** with minimal duplication of effort or dependencies.
5. Consideration of **styling and compatibility** for cross-browser usage.
6. Long-term **flexibility** and future-proofing.

---

## Considered Options

1. **LitElement + Web Components**  
   Use the LitElement library to build web components, which support templating, reactive properties, and encapsulated styling while adhering to web component standards.

2. **Embed Chatroom in Portfolio (React + MUI)**  
   Build the chatroom directly using React and Material-UI for immediate integration into the portfolio and other React-based applications.

3. **React Module Federation**  
   Use Module Federation with React, exposing the chatroom as a shared React component with dynamic loading capabilities.

4. **Pure Web Components (no libraries)**  
   Build the chatroom directly as native web components using only standard browser APIs (customElements, Shadow DOM, etc.) without any additional libraries.

---

## Decision Outcome

- **Chosen Option**: **Option 1: LitElement + Web Components**
  - **Reasoning**: This option satisfies the primary decision drivers of reusability, minimal dependencies, and long-term flexibility. It ensures the chatroom component can be consumed in React, Vue, and plain JavaScript environments while also supporting modern development practices and cross-framework compatibility.

### Positive Consequences

- Adheres to web component standards for framework-agnostic usage.
- Supports encapsulated styling via Shadow DOM.
- Ensures minimal dependencies and future-proofing.

### Negative Consequences

- Introduces a dependency (`LitElement`) that might duplicate across multiple web components.
- Requires polyfills for Shadow DOM in older browsers.
- Steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with LitElement.

---

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Shadow DOM compatibility issues in older environments.
  - **Mitigation**: Use polyfills to ensure compatibility where necessary.

- **Risk**: Dependency on LitElement could grow in larger ecosystems.
  - **Mitigation**: Monitor component usage patterns and consolidate shared libraries where possible to avoid duplication.

- **Risk**: Developers unfamiliar with LitElement may face onboarding challenges.
  - **Mitigation**: Provide internal training and comprehensive documentation for development standards.

## Analysis of the Options

### **Option 1: LitElement + Web Components**

- **Pros**:
  - Adheres to web component standards for framework-agnostic reusability.
  - Provides built-in **reactive properties** and templating, making DOM updates smoother.
  - Lightweight (~5KB gzipped) with minimal impact on bundle size.
  - Supports encapsulated styling and theming via Shadow DOM.

- **Cons**:
  - Small dependency added.
  - Requires polyfills for older module environments.
  - Slight learning curve for developers new to LitElement.

---

### **Option 2: Embed Chatroom in Portfolio (React + MUI)**

- **Pros**:
  - Fastest and most familiar option for React-heavy environments.
  - Advanced theming and styling support out of the box with Material-UI.

- **Cons**:
  - Strongly coupled to React, limiting reuse in other frameworks.
  - Larger bundle size compared to web components.
  - Refactoring for non-React environments becomes expensive.

---

### **Option 3: React Module Federation**

- **Pros**:
  - Enables dynamic loading of components in React-based environments.
  - Solves React-specific dependency management challenges.

- **Cons**:
  - Tied to React; not reusable in other frameworks.
  - Learning curve for implementing module federation at scale.
  - Dependency on React-native-compatible federation libraries.

---

### **Option 4: Pure Web Components (no libraries)**

- **Pros**:
  - No external dependencies; minimal bundle size.
  - Fully adheres to web standards (customElements, etc.).

- **Cons**:
  - Increased development time for managing reactive states without library support.
  - Lacks templating and other conveniences of standardized libraries like LitElement.

---

## Future Considerations

- Consider exploring new web standards or compatibility-enhancing libraries to further improve cross-framework performance.
- Regularly review LitElement's roadmap and community adoption to assess future risks to dependency longevity.
- Monitor for adoption of compatible browser polyfills to avoid additional runtime overhead.
