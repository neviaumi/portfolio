  - Highly optimized content rendering powered by **Astro.js**.
  - Features **React.js** dynamic components for interactive elements such as behavioral question answers or services listings.

2. **Personal Branding**:
  - Emphasizes your **skills**, **experience**, and **ways to collaborate**.
  - Supports **references and reviews** to strengthen trustworthiness.

3. **Service Monetization**:
  - Allows visitors to **request development services**.
  - **Stripe** integration handles secure payment processing.

4. **Question Handling**:
  - Answers **common behavioral questions** to facilitate a better understanding of your working and communication style.

5. **High Performance**:
  - Lightweight and fast builds through Astro.js for SEO-friendly and high-performance static website generation.
