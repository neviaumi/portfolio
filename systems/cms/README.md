## Getting Started

### 1. Setting Up Development

To set up the development environment, run the following command:

```bash
bash ./scripts/dev/setup.sh
```

This script will install all necessary dependencies and prepare the CMS system for development.

### 2. Starting the Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
bash ./scripts/dev/start.sh
```

This will launch the CMS locally, making it accessible for content management.

### 3. Running Tests

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
bash ./scripts/ci/test.sh
```

The `test.sh` script conducts:

- **TypeScript Type Checking**: Ensures codebase type safety using the TypeScript compiler.
- **ESLint Style Checking**: Validates the code's formatting and adheres to the project's linting rules.

---

## Docker Support

A `Dockerfile` is included for containerizing the CMS. Use the following commands to build and run the Docker container:

**Build the Docker Image:**

```bash
docker build -t cms-system .
```

**Run the Docker Container:**

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 cms-system
```

---

## Features

- **TinaCMS**: Provides an intuitive and flexible content management experience.
- **Automation Scripts**: Includes scripts to automate setup, testing, and server startup.
- **CI Integration**: Ensures code quality with type checking (`tsc`) and linting (`eslint`).
- **Modern Bundler**: Vite provides fast and efficient bundling.
- **Docker Support**: Simplifies deployment with containerization.

## Environment Variables

This CMS system uses environment variables for configuration. Follow these steps to set up the environment variables:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file and update the necessary variables based on your environment.

---

## Script Overview

Below is a summary of the important scripts available in the `scripts` directory:

### Development Scripts

- `bash ./scripts/dev/setup.sh`: Prepares the environment for development.
- `bash ./scripts/dev/start.sh`: Starts a local CMS server for content editing.

### CI Scripts

- `bash ./scripts/ci/test.sh`: Runs type checks with TypeScript and verifies style adherence with ESLint.

---

## Notes

- **TypeScript**: The CMS system uses TypeScript for enhanced code quality and development experience.
- **ESLint and Prettier**: Ensure consistent and high-quality code formatting.
- **Static Assets**: The `public/` directory contains any static files needed for the CMS.
