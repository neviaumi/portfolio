      If the thing such as by QA, coding style, data validation...etc. can be
      done by introduce some software change or configuration.


      As a engineer, i think it should evaluate and analysis the pro and cons. 

      Rather than just say it is what it is.

    brief: >-
      Instead of plan and implement all the features needed before rollout I
      prefer interactive approach that will rollout valuable features partially
      to users.


      I think it would the quicker and safer ways to mange Software release, as
      the bug and feature feedback would come near individually.

    brief: >-
      The key of effective communicate is courage to speak up when speaker off
      topic, over-explained the subject.


      As a non-native speaker, i always try me best to explain the ideas but i
      haven’t installed mind-reader yet. So i am appreciate colleagues can speak
      up when you think i am over-explained or off-topic.

    brief: >-
      I prefer working on hybrid environment as it provide the best balance
      between life and career and also provide effective communicate.


      I am happy to spend couple of hours for commuting to office on purpose
      but  i wasn’t happy on commuting to office without any interaction with
      co-workers as it i feel it just wasting both company and my time.
