    brief: >-
      As an engineer, I believe repetitive tasks like QA checks, coding style
      enforcement, or data validation should be automated whenever feasible.
      Thoughtful evaluation of pros and cons can transform “just the way it is”
      into efficient, reliable processes.

    brief: >-
      Rather than planning and implementing all features upfront, I favor an
      iterative approach—releasing valuable features incrementally. This method
      ensures quicker, safer rollouts and facilitates continuous feedback and
      improvement.
  - name: Communication
    icon: /uploads/icons/question_answer_24dp_E8EAED.svg
    brief: >-
      Effective communication hinges on clarity and courage. As a non-native
      speaker, I strive to express ideas concisely and welcome feedback when I
      over-explain or veer off topic. Constructive dialogue builds stronger
      teams and better outcomes.
  - name: Flexible

    brief: >-
      A hybrid work environment strikes the right balance between collaboration
      and personal focus. While I value purposeful office interactions, I
      believe commuting without meaningful engagement wastes both personal and
      company resources.
