    brief: >-
      Evolution is about continuous improvement, learning from past mistakes,
      and building on lessons to create better systems and workflows. It’s the
      commitment to growth, innovation, and adapting to challenges for
      sustainable success.
    description: >-
      Throughout my career, I’ve experienced diverse situations that have shaped
      my understanding of software development and the importance of evolution.

      Early in my career, I built a software system from scratch without clear
      guidance or collaboration. The result was a poorly documented and overly
      complex system—a “monster” of inefficiency. This taught me the dangers of
      making isolated decisions without strategic planning or documentation.

      In my next project, I worked on maintaining and integrating configurations
      into a legacy system. It was challenging to clean up and refactor code
      without a structured approach or a clear plan. Lacking experience, I
      endured these difficulties in silence, which only prolonged inefficiency
      and frustration.

      Later, I had the opportunity to work on a greenfield system with a mature
      team. Here, I learned critical skills like automated testing, Docker, and
      CI/CD. The team’s self-managed approach allowed us to prioritize features,
      allocate time for system cleanup, and deploy on our terms. This experience
      exemplified the power of evolution—adopting processes and tools that
      improve outcomes and collaboration.

      In my next project, I applied these lessons while working on a system for
      a startup. This project serves as a prime example of what “Evolution”
      means in action, explained below in STAR format.

      situation: >-
        I joined the team working on a full-stack system with no automated
        tests, relying solely on manual testing. The high rate of QA rejections
        (~50%) highlighted the fragility of the system.
      task: >-
        I was tasked with implementing internationalization (i18n) across the
        system. Recognizing this as an opportunity to introduce automated tests,
        I proposed addressing the lack of test coverage alongside the i18n
        implementation to ensure stability and prevent regressions.
      action: >-
        I collaborated with teammates to establish a testing approach. After
        researching best practices, we decided to implement both translations
        and automated tests simultaneously. Using Cypress and Jest, we covered
        each page and API endpoint while progressively rolling out i18n.
      result: >-
        The project successfully delivered an i18n-enabled website with
        comprehensive automated test coverage for both frontend and backend
        components. This significantly reduced QA rejections and established a
        solid foundation for future development. It also empowered junior
        developers to experiment safely, as tests provided immediate feedback on
        potential errors.

      From this experience, I’ve learned the importance of incorporating
      “engineering time” into project planning—dedicated periods for
      experimentation, research, and identifying opportunities for evolution. A
      small investment, such as one day in a two-week sprint, can lead to
      significant long-term improvements.

    brief: >-
      Interactive development emphasizes collaboration, iterative progress, and
      data-driven decisions. From unsupervised projects to Scrum-driven teams,
      I’ve learned that planning, breaking down tasks, and continuously
      deploying features foster better outcomes and stronger team dynamics.
    description: >-
      In my career, I’ve worked across various project management styles,
      including Waterfall, Kanban, Scrum, and even solo unsupervised projects.
      Each experience has shaped my understanding of effective collaboration and
      iterative development.

      On my first project, I worked in an unsupervised environment, handling
      everything from design to development and requirement gathering for a
      greenfield project. While this was a valuable opportunity to establish
      processes and practices, I lacked the knowledge and experience to do so
      effectively. The result was confusion and uncertainty about how to improve
      the situation.

      My second project introduced me to the Kanban style, which provided
      much-needed visibility into tasks, priorities, and progress. While it was
      an improvement, I found it lacked long-term planning and future
      visibility, as my role mainly involved fixing bugs and configuring an
      existing system.

      On my third project, I joined a mature Scrum team. This experience
      transformed my perspective on project management. We collaboratively
      planned, estimated, and split tasks while maintaining a clear definition
      of done. Regular demos and discussions with the product owner kept
      everyone aligned. Features were deployed continuously as they were
      completed, fostering a flexible and iterative approach.

      From these experiences, I’ve grown to appreciate Scrum-style management
      for its predictability, team collaboration, and encouragement of phased,
      multi-deployment feature development. This approach also enables a
      data-driven mindset—tracking feature usage and making informed decisions
      about product direction based on user behavior.

      Interactive development is not just about delivering features but about
      fostering collaboration, maintaining adaptability, and using feedback to
      guide the project’s evolution.

    brief: >-
      Effective communication is a two-way process. By clarifying ideas and
      confirming mutual understanding, I navigate language barriers and ensure
      collaboration. Responsiveness from teammates helps streamline discussions
      and fosters better teamwork.
    description: >-
      When I migrated to the United Kingdom, overcoming the language barrier
      became my top priority, as English is my second language. I initially
      struggled to explain or understand complex concepts, especially during
      long conversations where maintaining focus was challenging.

      To address this, I adopted a proactive approach. When unsure whether my
      message was understood, I would explain in greater detail to ensure
      clarity. Similarly, when I was uncertain about my own understanding, I
      would repeat my interpretation in my own words, seeking confirmation. This
      method proved effective, as it allowed me to validate my understanding and
      provide feedback where necessary.

      However, communication is a two-way process. My approach, while thorough,
      sometimes led to overcommunication, where I would overexplain in an
      attempt to ensure crystal clarity. To improve efficiency, I rely on
      responsive teammates who can quickly confirm their understanding or
      provide feedback. This responsiveness cuts unnecessary repetition and
      fosters a more streamlined and productive dialogue.

      Clear communication is about balancing detail with efficiency. It requires
      active listening, mutual confirmation, and the willingness to adjust based
      on team dynamics.

    brief: >-
      Flexibility in work configurations balances effective communication,
      focused productivity, and personal well-being. Hybrid setups combine the
      best of both worlds—team collaboration in the office and individual focus
      at home—offering an adaptable approach to modern work challenges.
    description: >-
      During the pandemic, I experienced different work configurations that
      reshaped my perspective on flexibility.

      Initially, most of my roles were fully on-site. While this setup fostered
      close-knit team dynamics and constructive feedback through constant
      interaction, it also came with significant drawbacks. The daily commute,
      sometimes exceeding three hours, disrupted the balance between personal
      and professional life.

      When the pandemic introduced hybrid working configurations, I experienced
      a better balance. Spending a few days in the office ensured effective
      communication during activities like planning and demos, while working
      from home provided focused time for individual tasks and greater
      flexibility in managing my schedule.

      After immigrating to the United Kingdom, I worked in a predominantly
      remote role while my teammates followed a hybrid model. This setup
      presented challenges, especially during discussions about implementation
      details or feature scopes. Being the only remote participant often left me
      excluded from spontaneous conversations, limiting my ability to contribute
      to decisions. This experience highlighted the importance of inclusive
      communication in flexible arrangements.

      Based on these experiences, my preferred working configuration is hybrid.
      It enables effective in-person collaboration, focused development from
      home, and the flexibility to allocate time between personal and
      professional priorities. A balanced hybrid model offers the adaptability
      needed for modern work environments.
