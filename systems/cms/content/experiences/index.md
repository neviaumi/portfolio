    resumeSummary: >
      As a Backend Engineer at Emma App Technologies, I implemented bank
      integrations and optimized banking connections to enhance user access for
      a personal finance app. I led the development of a QR code generator for
      marketing campaigns, resulting in improved performance tracking and
      immediate business value.
    portfolioIntro: >-
      Contributed to a personal finance app integrating with major banks like
      HSBC and Barclays. Focused on adding bank integrations, optimizing banking
      connections, and adapting mobile registration flows for the web. Delivered
      a QR code generator for marketing campaigns, enabling performance tracking
      for partners.
    detailedDescription: >-
      Emma is a subscription-based service that integrates with high-street
      banks like HSBC and Barclays. The app provides personal finance management
      features such as transaction tracking, monthly budget setup, and
      categorizing transactions by type.

      During my two-month tenure at Emma, I contributed to several impactful
      projects despite the short timeframe. My responsibilities included adding
      new bank integrations to enhance user access, optimizing the performance
      of banking connections, and cloning the registration flow from the mobile
      app to the website.

      One notable project I worked on was implementing a customized QR code
      generator for a marketing campaign page. This feature allowed Emma to
      connect with marketing partners and track performance metrics effectively.
      Once completed, it was deployed to production and immediately created
      business value.

      The work culture at Emma emphasized individual contributions, with minimal
      collaboration outside of weekly Monday meetings with the CEO to review
      progress and align on priorities.

      I decided to leave Emma after two months due to the demanding and costly
      daily commute to London, which felt unnecessary given the largely
      independent work style outside of the weekly meeting.

    role: Software Engineer II

    location: 'Liverpool, UK (remote)'

    resumeSummary: >-
      At PlayStation, I served as a Software Engineer II, primarily focusing on
      developing a frontend access management system for partner integration. I
      integrated frontend functionalities with APIs, managed a component
      library, and conducted experiments with micro frontend architecture to
      enhance collaboration and usability across team projects.
    portfolioIntro: >-
      Worked on a partner-facing platform, developing an access management
      system to manage user roles and permissions. Integrated frontend systems
      with APIs and maintained a component library. Introduced innovative
      methods for micro frontends and experimented with SaaS tools like feature
      flagging services.
    detailedDescription: >-
      I worked on a game development partner-facing platform at PlayStation.

      My primary focus was on the frontend of an access management system. This
      system allowed partners to create groups of existing users, and partner
      admins could assign roles to these groups. Other systems could then use
      the permissions associated with user roles to determine whether specific
      operations were permitted. However, I did not develop the API for external
      system integration. My role involved integrating the frontend with the API
      to support functionalities such as registering users to groups and adding
      permissions to teams.

      In addition to working on the frontend system features, I also maintained
      the component library by adding features and fixing bugs. I conducted
      experiments with SaaS tools to evaluate feature flag services and
      introduced new methods for micro frontend architecture.

      The work environment at PlayStation primarily followed a waterfall
      approach to project management, aiming to complete features for all users
      before releasing them. Although I believed a feature flag-based approach
      to roll out features incrementally could have been more effective, I had
      no influence over the release process. Apart from this, I found the work
      environment to be relaxed and straightforward. PlayStation's two-week
      sprint structure allowed for Fridays dedicated to research and learning. I
      used this time for proof of concept work, refactoring, and stack
      migrations. Most of my feature tasks involved integrating existing APIs or
      adding new components to the library.

      I decided to leave PlayStation because the development cycle didn't align
      with my preferred workflow, and I was the only fully remote member of the
      team. While my teammates worked in a hybrid setup and conducted in-person
      planning sessions, I remained remote, which made communication more
      challenging.

    resumeSummary: >-
      As a Software Engineer at Neat, I developed the registration system for
      virtual accounts, enhancing accessibility through translation features and
      establishing robust testing processes. My role involved technical
      mentorship and collaboration within a structured sprint cycle,
      contributing significantly to essential business functionalities and
      engineering effectiveness.
    portfolioIntro: >-
      Developed the registration system for Neat’s virtual account service for
      small businesses. Implemented translation features, established testing
      processes, and provided technical mentorship. Collaborated in a
      well-structured sprint cycle, contributing to key business features and
      engineering housekeeping.
    detailedDescription: >-
      Neat was a Hong Kong-based company that provided virtual account services
      for small business owners. With a virtual account, business owners could
      access features such as spending analysis and a dedicated bank account for
      managing their operations.

      I was part of a small team responsible for developing the registration
      system. My contributions included implementing translation functionality
      to make the platform accessible in Chinese, establishing testing
      processes, and providing technical support for less experienced team
      members.

      The working culture at Neat was fast-paced and demanding, but the
      structured planning process reduced stress. Every two weeks, the team
      reviewed the backlog and set sprint goals for the upcoming cycle. Thanks
      to the product owner’s efforts, this process ran smoothly. At the end of
      each sprint, we held demos to showcase progress on business features, and
      one day was allocated for engineering housekeeping tasks.

      I decided to leave Neat after relocating to the UK, as my role
      transitioned from hybrid to fully remote. The eight-hour time difference
      between Hong Kong and the UK made it difficult to stay engaged with the
      team. Seeking a fresh start in the UK, I began looking for new
      opportunities more aligned with my location and preferences.

    resumeSummary: >-
      As a Software Engineer at HK01, I developed internal systems for content
      editors, including a multi-channel messaging system and a secure single
      sign-on solution using OAuth 2. My role involved collaborating within a
      self-managed team to streamline workflows and improve user access control
      through effective feature development.
    portfolioIntro: >-
      Built internal tools for editors and journalists, including a
      multi-channel messaging system and a single sign-on login system using
      OAuth 2 with role-based permissions. Gained hands-on experience in
      self-managed, cross-functional teams, refining skills in task estimation
      and collaborative feature development.
    detailedDescription: >-
      HK01 is an online media company that produces news and other content for
      the public.

      As part of the development team, I contributed to building internal
      systems for content editors and journalists. My key projects included
      developing a messaging system from scratch, enabling editors to send
      messages to end users through various channels such as SMS, in-app
      messages, app notifications, and web notifications. I also implemented an
      internal login system using the OAuth 2 protocol, which allowed single
      sign-on across multiple components. This system included role-based
      permissions so that admins could control access levels for different
      users.

      The working culture at HK01 was one of the highlights of my experience. I
      worked in a self-managed, cross-functional team led by an accountable and
      supportive team leader. The team leader handled communication with the
      product owner and facilitated backlog refinement sessions where we broke
      down features into smaller, executable tasks. We estimated story points to
      evaluate task complexity and collaboratively decided on feature rollouts.
      This environment taught me how to be a self-managed engineer and an
      effective team player.

      I left HK01 to migrate from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom.
      Unfortunately, HK01 did not offer relocation options, which led me to
      pursue new opportunities.
