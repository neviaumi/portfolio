title: Core Values
whatAreCoreValues: >-
  When work occupies over 30 hours of my week, it’s crucial to identify the
  environment and working style that align with my goals and bring fulfillment
  to my daily tasks. Core values are my personal compass—they guide how I
  approach my work and interact as a professional engineer.

  These values also represent a commitment to the standards I uphold in my
  career. While they may evolve with time and experience, they serve as a
  foundation for how I navigate challenges and opportunities today.

  Currently, I have identified four key values that matter most to me:
  Evolution, Interactive Development, Communication, and Flexibility. Each of
  these plays a critical role in fostering a productive, collaborative, and
  forward-thinking work environment.

  In essence, I am seeking roles that provide:

  A flexible working environment that respects work-life balance.

  A team that embraces exploration of alternative solutions and innovation.

  Open and transparent collaboration.

  An interactive, feedback-driven approach to development.

  In the sections below, I’ll explain why these values matter and how they shape
  my work ethic and professional expectations.
