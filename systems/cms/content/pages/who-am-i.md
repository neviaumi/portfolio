    comments: "I had the pleasure of working alongside Kong Chor at PlayStation, and I can con\0dently say that he is one of the most talented and dependable professionals I’ve had the privilege to collaborate with. Kong brings an exceptional combination of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a team-\0rst attitude to everything he does. His pro\0ciency in JS/TS stacks and his ability to quickly grasp the nuances of complex systems made him an indispensable asset to our team. Beyond his technical skills, Kong stands out for his collaborative and supportive nature. He’s always willing to lend a hand, share insights, or help other team members. I highly recommend Kong to any team or organization looking for a skilled and dedicated software engineer. He will undoubtedly make a lasting impact wherever he goes."

    relationship: Neat Lead Engineer
    comments: "When I joined Neat I had limited experience with web development and JavaScript. Luckily, I had Chor on my team! Chor is extremely experienced in JS development and he's a very patient person. Despite the pandemic he made the effort to commute to o\0ce everyday to teach me the ins and outs of Neat's system face to face. He truly enabled the team to excel technically. He inspired us to use the best technologies for the job and explained them when needed. I hope to work together with Chor again in the future."

      During two years of working with David, we learn, growth and teaching each
      others in many ways. He give great effort and contribution to the team.
      Suggesting different solutions and tools to help solving many technical
      problems. Most importantly David help mentoring Junior developers. To help
      them get through hard time and start contributing the team more quickly.
      Without David our team will not be that successful. Highly recommend him
      to any company for a excellent team player.
