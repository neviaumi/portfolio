    comments: "I had the pleasure of working alongside Kong Chor at PlayStation, and I can con\0dently say that he is one of the most talented and dependable professionals I’ve had the privilege to collaborate with. Kong brings an exceptional combination of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a team-\0rst attitude to everything he does. His pro\0ciency in JS/TS stacks and his ability to quickly grasp the nuances of complex systems made him an indispensable asset to our team. Beyond his technical skills, Kong stands out for his collaborative and supportive nature. He’s always willing to lend a hand, share insights, or help other team members. I highly recommend Kong to any team or organization looking for a skilled and dedicated software engineer. He will undoubtedly make a lasting impact wherever he goes."

    comments: "When I joined Neat I had limited experience with web development and JavaScript. Luckily, I had Chor on my team! Chor is extremely experienced in JS development and he's a very patient person. Despite the pandemic he made the effort to commute to o\0ce everyday to teach me the ins and outs of Neat's system face to face. He truly enabled the team to excel technically. He inspired us to use the best technologies for the job and explained them when needed. I hope to work together with Chor again in the future."

      During two years of working with David, we learn, growth and teaching each
      others in many ways. He give great effort and contribution to the team.
      Suggesting different solutions and tools to help solving many technical
      problems. Most importantly David help mentoring Junior developers. To help
      them get through hard time and start contributing the team more quickly.
      Without David our team will not be that successful. Highly recommend him
      to any company for a excellent team player.

      I worked with David for the past two years, He is an innovative team
      player and created many automated tools to improve team efficiency and
      product quality. He is able to apply his innovative mind on spotting quick
      solutions for complex problems, which is essential for a fast development
      pace. He is also very willing to speak up when he spotted problems and
      usually come up with solutions. If the right solution is obscure, he could
      manage to use data to deduce the right one. He is also willing to share
      his skills, knowledge and new findings to team members which improve the
      whole team productivity. I recommend him if you are looking for an
      engineer who can handle fast development cycles like startup company.

  careerOverview: >-
    I began my career in 2014 as a Web Developer for a small local business,
    later expanding my experience across diverse environments, from tech
    startups to multinational corporations. Over the years, I’ve grown
    technically and reshaped my perspective on work, striving to create balance
    and purpose in my professional life.


    Initially, I focused on crafting overengineered solutions that anticipated
    every possible scenario—even those unlikely to occur. Through experience, I
    learned that simplicity, combined with automated testing, is key to creating
    scalable, maintainable systems that can evolve over time.


    Midway through my journey, I embraced Agile methodology, which introduced an
    iterative, feedback-driven approach to development. Delivering features
    incrementally enables faster validation and refinement, avoiding the
    pitfalls of building a product nobody wants. However, effective Agile relies
    on transparent communication—teams must uphold the definition of “done,”
    resist unreasonable timelines, and openly discuss technical concerns with
    product owners.


    Throughout my journey, I’ve remained committed to building meaningful
    solutions that align with business goals, always seeking to combine
    technical excellence with practical impact.
