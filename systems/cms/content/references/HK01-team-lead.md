  During two years of working with David, we learn, growth and teaching each
  others in many ways. He give great effort and contribution to the team.
  Suggesting different solutions and tools to help solving many technical
  problems. Most importantly David help mentoring Junior developers. To help
  them get through hard time and start contributing the team more quickly.

  Without David our team will not be that successful. Highly recommend him to
  any company for a excellent team player.
