  When I joined Neat I had limited experience with web development and
  JavaScript. Luckily, I had Chor on my team! Chor is extremely experienced in
  JS development and he's a very patient person. Despite the pandemic he made
  the effort to commute to once everyday to teach me the ins and outs of Neat's
  system face to face. He truly enabled the team to excel technically. He
  inspired us to use the best technologies for the job and explained them when
  needed. I hope to work together with Chor again in the future.
