  I worked with David for the past two years, He is an innovative team player
  and created many automated tools to improve team efficiency and product
  quality. He is able to apply his innovative mind on spotting quick solutions
  for complex problems, which is essential for a fast development pace. He is
  also very willing to speak up when he spotted problems and usually come up
  with solutions. If the right solution is obscure, he could manage to use data
  to deduce the right one. He is also willing to share his skills, knowledge and
  new findings to team members which improve the whole team productivity. I
  recommend him if you are looking for an engineer who can handle fast
  development cycles like startup company.
