  I had the pleasure of working alongside Kong Chor at PlayStation, and I can
  confidently say that he is one of the most talented and dependable
  professionals I’ve had the privilege to collaborate with. Kong brings an
  exceptional combination of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a
  team-first attitude to everything he does. His proficiency in JS/TS stacks and
  his ability to quickly grasp the nuances of complex systems made him an
  indispensable asset to our team. Beyond his technical skills, Kong stands out
  for his collaborative and supportive nature. He’s always willing to lend a
  hand, share insights, or help other team members. I highly recommend Kong to
  any team or organization looking for a skilled and dedicated software
  engineer. He will undoubtedly make a lasting impact wherever he goes.
