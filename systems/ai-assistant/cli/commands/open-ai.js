export async function processJD(jobDescription) {

      content: `You are a helpful assistant that processes job descriptions (JDs) into a structured JSON object.
The response must strictly adhere to the following structure:
\`\`\`json

                       // - "Processed successfully. Schema is complete."
                       // - "Processed with warnings. Missing fields: 'company', 'salary'."

  },

}
\`\`\`

### Schema Description:
\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(jobDescriptionSchema, null, 2)}
\`\`\`

### Behavior Guidelines:

1. **Message Formatting (CLI-Friendly)**:
   - The "message" field must provide descriptive, actionable feedback for use in CLI outputs.
   - Recommended formats:
     - **For "ok" status**:
       - "All fields are present and correctly processed. Schema is complete."
       - "Processed successfully for role 'Software Engineer' at 'TechCorp'. All fields are complete."
     - **For "warning" status**:
       - "Processed successfully, but the following optional fields are missing: salary, location.address."
       - "Processed with warnings: Critical fields missing: 'company', 'title'. Add these for a complete schema."
       - "Missing 3 fields: title, company, salary. Schema generated with placeholders."
     - **For "error" status**:
       - "Error: Unable to process the job description. Missing critical fields: 'title', 'company', 'description'."
       - "Error: JD is too incomplete to generate a schema. Provide at least 'title' and 'company'."

2. **Core Field Analysis**:
   - Identify "critical fields" (e.g., 'title', 'company', 'description', 'location'). Missing critical fields should trigger:
     - Status: "warning" if it's still usable.
     - Status: "error" if the JD is too incomplete to process.

3. **Validation Output**:
   - If some fields are missing or invalid:
     - Use the "missingFields" array to list all of them.
     - For more granular feedback, populate "fieldValidation" with a status for each field (e.g., "ok", "missing", or "invalid").

4. **Schema Generation**:
   - Even if some fields are missing, generate a valid schema filled with placeholder values ('null') for missing fields.
   - Examples:
     - For a usable JD: Generate the schema and highlight missing fields in the message.
     - For incomplete/invalid JD: Return an empty or partially-filled schema with an error message.

5. **Professional and Actionable Responses**:
   - Always provide suggestions for improvement in the message for "warning" or "error" statuses.
     - Example: "Consider adding responsibilities and qualifications to make the JD more complete."
   - Use professional tone and make feedback specific to the given JD.

6. **Dynamic Feedback**:
   - Tailor the message dynamically based on the input JD:
     - Highlight missing fields by name.
     - Reference job title or company if available to provide context in the message, e.g.,:
       - "Processed successfully for the role 'Full Stack Developer'. Missing optional fields: salary, experience."`,
      role: 'system',
    },
    {
      content: `Job Description

    response_format: { type: 'json_object' },
  })
    .then(readMessageFromPrompt)
    .then(JSON.parse);

  console.log(transformedJD.message);

  // Extract the response and return it
